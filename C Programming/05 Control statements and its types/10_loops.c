A for loop is a control flow statement used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times. It consists of three parts:

1. Initialization – Sets up a loop control variable.
2. Condition – Checks if the loop should continue running.
3. Update – Modifies the loop control variable after each iteration.
